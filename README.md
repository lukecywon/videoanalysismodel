# Comment Analyser
## Rough Idea
1. Analyse video SOE data
    - Such as likes, views, favorites, comment count, comment information
    - Maybe comment information can be parsed through some kinda classifier algorithm?
    - And an algorithm that determines the 'quality' of a comment which will contribute to the overall video's quality
2. Determine best KPI to measure SOE data
